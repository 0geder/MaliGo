# MaliGo: Financial Literacy & Gamified Savings for South Africa

## About MaliGo

MaliGo is a mobile-first, gamified financial literacy and micro-savings platform designed for South African youth and low-income communities. Powered by an energetic mascot, Mali the Meerkat, users engage with savings challenges, budgeting tools, and mini-games to earn rewards like airtime, vouchers, or micro-top-ups.

With accessibility via both smartphone app and USSD, MaliGo empowers users to learn money skills and build consistent saving habits one small step at a time.

## The Problem We're Solving

South Africa faces a deep financial literacy and savings challenge:
- **Low financial literacy**: Most South Africans lack understanding of budgeting, interest, and debt
- **Minimal savings culture**: Less than 30% of adults actively save; many live paycheck-to-paycheck
- **Limited financial access**: Millions rely on feature phones or informal financial systems
- **Poor engagement with traditional tools**: Banking apps don't motivate or teach

## Our Solution

A friendly, gamified platform where users:
- Take daily savings challenges
- Earn micro-rewards
- Learn through bite-sized games and quizzes
- Set real-world savings goals
- Compete in peer-to-peer duels and leaderboards

## Meet Mali the Meerkat

Our mascot Mali (means "money" in Zulu & Swahili) is a witty, supportive meerkat who guides users through their financial journey. Mali celebrates every milestone, delivers lessons with local humor, and keeps users motivated with daily missions and encouragement.
